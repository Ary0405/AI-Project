# Rubik's Cube Solver using BFS Search with Heuristic

This Python code introduces a solver for the Rubik's Cube that utilizes the BFS search algorithm with a specified heuristic function. The algorithm aims to find the optimal sequence of moves from an initial state to a solved state, considering a set of possible moves and the cube's dimension.

## Algorithm Overview

The `solve_cube_with_heuristic` function takes several parameters, including the initial state of the Rubik's Cube (`initial_state`), the solved state (`solved_state`), the set of possible moves (`possible_moves`), the cube dimension (`n`), and a heuristic function (`heuristic`). The heuristic function is crucial for evaluating the desirability of potential moves, guiding the search towards more promising paths.

The algorithm initializes a queue and a set to keep track of visited states, similar to the BFS-based solution. The main difference lies in the prioritization of successors based on their heuristic values. Successors are generated by applying each possible move to the current state, and they are sorted in ascending order of heuristic values.

The while loop continues until the queue is empty or the solved state is reached. During each iteration, the current state and the sequence of moves so far are dequeued, and the cube's current state is displayed for visualization. If the current state matches the solved state, the function returns the optimal sequence of moves. Otherwise, the algorithm explores successors in a prioritized manner, considering the heuristic values.

## Usage

To use the algorithm, call the `solve_cube_with_heuristic` function with appropriate arguments, including the initial state, solved state, possible moves, cube dimension, and a heuristic function. The function returns the optimal sequence of moves to solve the Rubik's Cube.

```python
from collections import deque
from rubix_cube_display import display_cube
from rubix_cube_move import apply_move

def solve_cube_with_heuristic(initial_state, solved_state, possible_moves, n, heuristic):
    # ... (code implementation)
    return optimal_moves
```

Note: The visual representation of the cube is displayed during the algorithm's execution, providing insight into the solving process enhanced by the heuristic guidance.
